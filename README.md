Hello Everyone!
This is a video created for the demonstration purposes of the Design project of CS4362 - Hardware Description Languages.

With the high demand for wireless data traffic, WiFi networks have very rapid growth because they provide high throughput and are easy to deploy. 
Recently, Channel State Information (CSI) measured by WiFi networks is widely used for different sensing purposes.

**OFDM
Along with Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM), MIMO provides Channel State Information (CSI) for each transmit and receive antenna pair 
at each carrier frequency.

**What is CSI
CSI represents how wireless signals propagate from the transmitter to the receiver at certain carrier frequencies along multiple paths.
For a WiFi system with MIMO-OFDM, CSI is a 3D matrix of complex values representing the amplitude attenuation and phase shift of multi-path WiFi channels.

Recently, CSI measurements from WiFi systems are used for different sensing purposes.  
Moreover, unlike sensor-based and video-based solutions, WiFi sensing is not intrusive or sensitive to lighting conditions.

CSI measurements captures how wireless signals travel through surrounding objects and humans in time, frequency, and spatial domains, so it can be used for different wireless sensing applications. 
For example, CSI amplitude variations in the time domain have different patterns for different humans, activities, gestures, etc., which can be used for human presence detection, fall detection, motion detection, activity recognition, gesture recognition, and human identification/authentication.
CSI phase shifts in the spatial and frequency domains are related to signal transmission delay and direction, which can be used for human localization and tracking.
Meanwhile, time domain phase shifts may have different dominant frequency components which can be used to estimate breathing rate.
